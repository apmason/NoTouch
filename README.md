# NoTouch

![alt text](Images/logo.png)

NoTouch is a Mac, iPhone, and iPad app that uses the front facing camera and machine learning to alert a user if they are touching their face. The app is built with SwiftUI. CloudKit is integrated to securely track the number of times a user touches their face. A custom graph visualization of this CloudKit data, written in SwiftUI, is also included in the app.
