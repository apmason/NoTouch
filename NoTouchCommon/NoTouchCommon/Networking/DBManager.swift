    }
    
    // What we want is: make a batched call to get records that occured on today (using a predicate).
    // we then store this data in the `userSettings.recordHolder`. Write tests for that. We can test the DBManager class. We will pass in a dummy `UserSettings` object. We will fetch records. We should pass in the DB stub that we want. (CloudKitDatabase should be a protocol, we can make a stub that performs the actions that we want (returning an array of TouchRecords)).
    
    /**
     
     Things to find out:
     -
     - What is the API to use to call into CloudKit with a predicate? <-- Doing this NOW.
     "When using such an operator, it is recommended that you use a cursor to batch the results into smaller groups for processing." - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/ckquery
     - Is there any error handling that needs to be done for that? Refetching if it decides to only get so many records?
     - Are there performance implications for storing all the records individually? I can't imagine that on the client side it will take up that much space.
     
     Other TODOs:
     -
     - What if CloudKit isn't available? We'll need to present something to the user telling them so. Is there a callback that we use to monitor for that? How do you present an action sheet in SwiftUI?
