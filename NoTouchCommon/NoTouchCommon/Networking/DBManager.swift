     Things to find out:
     -
     - Is there any error handling that needs to be done for that? Refetching if it decides to only get so many records?
     
     Other TODOs:
     -
     - What if CloudKit isn't available? We'll need to present something to the user telling them so. Is there a callback that we use to monitor for that? How do you present an action sheet in SwiftUI?
